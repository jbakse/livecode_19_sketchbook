# TODO

# DIRTY
. appending "sketches/" all over the place, probably just do that once at top
. shoudld the show*() functions be DRYer? they all have the same general steps, and could be, but keeping them seperate makes it easier to handle special cases (maybe)
. move the wrapper <div> and <pre> tags from show*() to the .handlebars?
. change "plugin" to "view"? or actually put some of the show*() code in so they are more like plugins.
. the sketchbook/js/* modules export everything, narrow down
