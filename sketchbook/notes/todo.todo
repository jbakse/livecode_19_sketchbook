Refactor Plugins:
    □ "template_builders" or "plugins" pick a name and make it consistent
    □ move the code that does the building out of template_builders and into the plugins folders
    □ remove handlebars dep?
    □ remove the jdi dep, or move it into the md.js plugin
    □ move to modules (actually its pretty much modules already, other than the vendor deps)
