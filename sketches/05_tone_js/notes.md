Be sure to read through the [overview](https://tonejs.github.io/), browse the [API docs](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/), and look at ALL the [examples](https://tonejs.github.io/examples/).

At least you will learn the names of interesting techniques and common paramters. You can studythe [code for the examples](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/tree/dev/examples) also.
