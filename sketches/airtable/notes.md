# Security

- Propery security is out of scope of this introduction.
- These demos are not secure.
- The things you make—following these demos—won't be secure.
- Because security is not considered, it would be possible for someone to vandalize the data in your databases.
- If you are using Airtable just for this project, thats mostly fine.
- If you have other data in Airtable, you may want to create a seperate account for just class stuff.

# The Library Doesn't Quite Work

- Is this still true?
