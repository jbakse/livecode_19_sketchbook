Be sure to read through the [overview](https://tonejs.github.io/), browse the [API docs](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/), and look at ALL the [examples](https://tonejs.github.io/examples/). By looking at the examples you will learn what the library can do, and you'll also learn a fair amount about different synthesis techniques. At the least, you will learn the names of some interesting techniques and common parameters. You can study the [code for the examples](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/tree/dev/examples) also.
