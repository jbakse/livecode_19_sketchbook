        <h2>Glitch</h2>
        <p>
          Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new
          medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the
          jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these
          will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It's
          the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going
          out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart.
          The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the
          medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice
          is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that
          releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and
          white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the
          medium assigned to record them.

          So you think I got an evil mind? I'll tell you, honey <br />
          I don't know why, I don't know why <br />
          So you think my singing's out of time? It makes me money <br />
          I don't know why, I don't know why <br />
